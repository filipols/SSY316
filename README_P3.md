Player Skill Estimation with Gibbs Sampling
This Jupyter Notebook implements a Gibbs sampler to estimate player skills based on observed match outcomes. 

It includes:

Posterior Distribution Analysis: Uses analytical expressions to derive and validate distributions
Gibbs Sampling: Simulates samples from the posterior distribution.
Accuracy Evaluation: Compares Gibbs sampler results to analytical values, varying the number of samples post-burn-in.
Visualization: Plots posterior distributions, sampler traces, and accuracy vs. runtime, team rankings from ADF, statistics of the SerieA dataset


Requirements are found in requirements.txt, which are the same for all parts of this project.
